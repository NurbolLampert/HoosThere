  <h1>Why I Chose VS Code by Nurbol Lampert (cqq7gs)</h1>
  <p>
    I chose <strong>VS Code</strong> because it has strong support for <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, and TypeScript</strong>, which are essential for this course. 
    Additionally, it provides extensions for <strong>Docker and PostgreSQL</strong>, making it easier to work with our development environment.
  </p>
  <p>
    VS Code also integrates well with GitHub and has built-in terminal support, allowing me to work seamlessly without switching between applications.
